package main
// Package main contains networking functionality, to interpret request.

//GoDungeon will manager virtual chest, I.E. Guild Chest monitoring between multiple server(s).
//To ensure there aren't any duplications. So multiple players from the same guild can spread out
//on the different shards and all interact with the guild vault at the same time, if a player adjust
//an item in the inventory, (adds/removes/moves) item. It'll update for all players that have the
//vault open, real time. Cons: possible delay, (20-30 milliseconds).
