Coming Soon.

To whom it may concern,

I St. Peter, am about to speak the word of God. Please make sure you’re seated whilst you read the unforgiving and slanderous words of the truth. We may be known as “The developers whom shall not be named”, or “CherryIO”, whichever is your preference. As most of you are aware, we updated the DungeonRealms source to 1.8 upon receiving it from Minecade. This was our first encounter with DungeonRealms, we didn’t play it in the past. “We”, are one Bukkit developer, and two Forge developers. During the update process we launched a TeamSpeak server, there was a lot of immediate traffic, players returning from years of disappointment. We spoke with people, talked about the past and generally had a good time. Unfortunately, with the good, comes the bad. There were trolls, mostly easy to handle, and some, not so easy. If you played during our time at DungeonRealms and were involved into the community beyond just joining the server you’d have experienced these trolls first hand.
	Atlas_ and I were sitting in a channel on DestinyMC’s Teamspeak when we received a message from a default in the main lobby. This individual said that he owned DungeonRealms, and that Felipe the owner of Minecade had already signed everything over to him. This individual was known as Kayaba. We asked Kayaba to show us the contact Felipe signed. He said sure, but he has to “find” it. I’ll summarize from here; Kayaba was lying, he didn’t have a signature from Felipe, we even asked Felipe about Kayaba, and Felipe’s response was, “Yeah, idk that guy is weird.”. After this we banned Kayaba for lying, and then talked a little shit on him in Teamspeak for stringing us along for many hours. This angered Kayaba extremely, he headed back over to the “official DungeonRealms community” socialconquer. His community was built on DungeonRealms source and I reckon some players played it. He continuously bypassed Teamspeak Bans and spammed the TeamSpeak with his community, he even started this behavior in-game. There was a point whereabouts everyone knew what socialconquer was.
	He’s a troll, no? He’s mentally disabled. That became a popular subject around TeamSpeak, I originally assumed that he’s just upset that his community was about to be out-sourced entirely, but, several individuals around TeamSpeak said he had mental issues. Anyhow, volatile actions such as his weren’t allowed, so we continued to ban him. Through all the banning and occasional conversations, we had with him in TeamSpeak. I realized that he’s not all troll, he understands laid out logic. We agreed that the spamming and harassment need to stop. Kayaba was then allowed to join the Teamspeak and speak freely as others.
	He didn’t see the train. Unfortunately for Kayaba he didn’t realize that with the reputation he earned, he’d be trolled. This led to some outrageous moments, and threats. During one of these moments a staff member permanently banned Kayaba because of his actions. Atlas__ nor I didn’t know immediately, and Kayaba thought we knew? So he continued to spam the server, and at one point he even joined the TeamSpeak whilst the servers were being knocked offline and said, “I may know who’s doing it, but if we can get some kind of agreement I’m sure they’ll come back online”. Atlas_ and I figured that he’s just not mentally stable and that he backed out on the terms we discussed. He ended up getting permanently banned, again…
	We left, we were gone. Entirely uninvolved with DungeonRealms. We left on good terms, at least I thought. Nah, that wasn’t the case. Atlas_ had acquired Kayaba to lead development, yes. Kayaba, the one who caused all the drama at the beginning. This was a slap in the face, but again. We weren’t involved directly, we may have occasionally visited the website to see how things were going, but no direct involvement. Time continued its path, forward. After months of not being involved I start hearing comments, whispers. I ignore these comments, because comments, don’t necessarily bother me. Slander does. Once I received proof of this defamation and the notation that our code was being sifted and edited half-heartedly, I almost had an aneurism. I literally fell sideways in my chair, and started to shake uncontrollably. As of Christ our lord was dipping me into the pond of eternal life. As my soul was given back to me, I felt this inner objective to stop this. I messaged Atlas__, via Skype.
	I spoke with Atlas_ on TeamSpeak about the things I’ve heard and seen. Kayaba was present in the channel, with his mic muted, most of the time. He occasionally unmuted to give his 50 cents. Through my casual talking, he became enraged and permanently banned myself, Xwaffle, and Proxying. Atlas__ messaged me on skype to reconnect.

	I continued to talk with Atlas__ about his scare tactics, and behavior. Why else would I even message him? I haven’t got involved in months, why now? Atlas__ seemed to understand what I was saying, then. Things got really interesting. Yeezy, the manager at DestinyMC joined and agreed with what I was saying. Yeezy said, “Yeah that guy needs to go, he’s threatened several people around here. I’ve gotten like so many reports”. Atlas_ was shocked. Yeezy didn’t tell Atlas_? At this point Atlas_ began to plan for a demotion. Atlas was preparing fail-safes should Kayaba try to-do malicious things once his permissions were removed. Atlas_ then asked us if we’d contribute to the code, I said sure, but it’s be on our leisure time, we couldn’t be fully dedicated. He said, that’s not a problem, we’ve got other developers and communicate via Slack, we’ve got things setup on JIRA so bugs are easy, all you’d have to-do is read the bugs and submit fixes. Atlas__ through our differences and disagreements still knew that we’re not malicious, so this comment; “Will you guys contribute to the code” didn’t take me by surprise.
	As our conversation with Atlas_ came to an end, he said; “Yeah, let me just talk with the other developers and see how Kayaba acts with them”, then; “I’ll take a couple of days for me to sort things out”. My eyebrow flickered, as it always does when someone’s lying. I anticipated that Atlas__ wouldn’t follow through with what we had said. So once the conversation was over, I continued to code. I messaged Atlas_ the next day with; “Any Update?” and Atlas_ replied back with ![ScreenShot](https://i.gyazo.com/a06728056035e3a5e08cc1c955dfe21d.png).

As you can see, it includes.
“Slanderous comments shouldn’t be going around ANYMORE. “– This direct quote shows truth that slander was committed.
“They all want him to stay on, if he just does code and stays out of their business.” – So there is some truth that Kayaba is expanding his influence, considering he’s getting involved in staff business.
After that, I messaged Atlas__ and told him that I had already anticipated this happening, and that I hope he anticipated my move. Which is to development a DungeonRealms hybrid and release it publically. This isn’t to hurt DungeonRealms, DungeonRealms has its brand. Jake from state farm isn’t going to throw up a DungeonRealms server on jakefromstatefarm.com and have 200 players, that’s a preposterous notion. The players of DungeonRealms deserve to know the truth, whether it be this way, or an announcement from Atlas_. Me creating his hybrid and releasing it benefits Atlas_’s DungeonRealms tremendously.
	I know deep down that the leech Kayaba, will regularly check this repository and sift through the code. I know that he’ll take the architecture and have a different view point on how things should be run. And from this, I’ll receive satisfaction, satisfaction knowing that he checks this repository regularly and sifts the code. As he’s done in the past, and continues to-do.

I may not necessarily consider legal actions such as a DMCA, but, should this slander continue to occur, not only will a hybrid version be released, a server will as-well, dungeonrealms.org.
It’s ignorant to ignore the issues at hand. I don’t enjoy coding this, although I now have a better understanding of DungeonRealms inner workings. As I’ve told Atlas_, I won’t use old source. I’ll development his hybrid using in-memory caching and NoSQL storage if necessary. I’ll literally create the ultimate environment, an environment that’ll emulate the good ol’ days 100%.
I’ve received messages from some individuals wanting to contribute, or assist in anyway necessary. I appreciate your messages; however, this will only be a thing should Atlas__ continue ignore the behavior in his inner circle. As you can see, I’m 25% done. It’s taken 1 ½ days of coding to accomplish this, and it’s on Minecraft 1.9. Yeah, I’m able to let you hit as fast as you can click, so cut the shit.
