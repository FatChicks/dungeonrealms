### The DungeonRealms .ORG Franchise
Coming soon.

Use to playing on (.net)? Not to worry, we'll be appealing to all players by incorporating our own emulation of (.net).
Featuring: Simulated Lag spikes, randomized rollbacks, downtime and more!


### The Project
A person isn't born with infinite endurance, there's a point where enough pain
can be deemed as torture. DungeonRealms has appealed to thousands of players over
it's years of existence. Through that time it's been slain, revived, and choked.
The cycle repeats itself about three more times. The time has come to let the market place
create the most appealing server for players to play on. The game should no longer be controlled
by a select few. The incompetence of the current (.net) management has only further proven my
theory.

1: Take a moment of your time to browse (.net's) front page, let the incompetence fill you.

As a previous developer of DungeonRealms I do harbor working source-code, but.
I'm satisfied with it's functionality and would rather release a drag-and-drop
plugin.

It is still unclear whether or not (.org) will be an actual server, but, what I do
know is that a public plugin will be released. I look forward to the competition
within the market place to create the perfect environment for us players.

I look forward to having this repository forked, and the code modified. I encourage it.

### Features
If you aren't up for editing the source directly, this project includes an api.
A full javadoc on the api will be available soon.

### DungeonBungee
This is a Java Module inside the DungeonRealms project.
This is a Bungee plugin, that'll handle parties and other network related things.

### GoDungeon
I'm utilizing Google's Go Programming Language to handle multiple server interaction
with guild vaults. (More usage coming soon)
